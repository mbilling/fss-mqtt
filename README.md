# fss-mqtt

A fast, keyboard-driven MQTT explorer for the terminal. Subscribe to a broker and get a
live topic tree you narrow down just by typing; see payloads decoded, their numbers charted and
anomalies flagged as they arrive; edit any message and publish it again.

### OmaMQTT (Omarchy)

![OmaMQTT in Omarchy's Tokyo Night theme: browsing two brokers and charting a topic's numbers; partway through, Omarchy switches to its Osaka Jade theme and OmaMQTT's colours follow; the keys pressed show below](docs/omamqtt.gif)

Started as `omamqtt`, fss-mqtt goes by OmaMQTT and shows the current
[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) theme's colours, and changes with the theme while it runs.
Otherwise it's fss-mqtt, with the same keys, connections file
(`~/.config/fss-mqtt/connections.toml`) and session. Without Omarchy it keeps its own colours.
What makes it OmaMQTT is the name it's started by, so a link does it:

```sh
ln -s "$(command -v fss-mqtt)" ~/.local/bin/omamqtt
```

`packaging/omarchy` has its launcher entry and icon, for a package to install.

From source (Rust 1.88+):

```sh
cargo build --release        # → target/release/fss-mqtt (~1.1 MB)
cargo install --path .       # or install it to ~/.cargo/bin
```

## Usage

```sh
fss-mqtt broker.example.com                # connect (and save the connection)
fss-mqtt mqtts://broker:8883 -u me         # TLS (system trust store); asks for the password
fss-mqtt broker:8883 --cafile ca.pem       # TLS with your own CA
fss-mqtt broker:8883 --cafile ca.pem --cert me.pem --key me.key   # mutual TLS
fss-mqtt wss://broker.example.com:8884/mqtt -u me   # MQTT over WebSockets, with TLS
fss-mqtt broker:8883 --proxy http://proxy.corp:8080   # through an HTTP proxy (or socks5://)
fss-mqtt broker -t 'v1/#' -t '$SYS/#'      # several subscriptions
fss-mqtt wss://test.mosquitto.org:8081/mqtt -t '$SYS/#'   # a public test broker's own statistics
fss-mqtt                                   # connect the saved connections marked autoconnect
fss-mqtt -c local -c staging               # connect these saved connections
```

Connects with MQTT v5 (so user properties are visible) and reconnects automatically, over TCP,
TLS or WebSockets: `ws://` (port 80 unless given) and `wss://` (443), asking for the URL's path,
or `/mqtt` without one. A `wss://` connection takes the same TLS options as `mqtts://`.
Credentials in a URL (`user:password@`) aren't used to log in: give them with `-u` and
`password_env` (or when asked).
`FSS_MQTT_BROKER`, `FSS_MQTT_USERNAME`, `FSS_MQTT_PASSWORD`, `FSS_MQTT_CAFILE` and
`FSS_MQTT_KEY_PASSWORD` (the `--key` passphrase) are read from the environment.
With no saved connections and no broker given, it connects to `mqtt://localhost:1883` (not saved).

## Connections

Several brokers can be connected at once. Each is a top-level branch in the topic tree and keeps its
own topics and history while you connect, disconnect or pause its subscriptions. Filters match
below the broker level, so `devices/#` shows matches from every broker.

In the connections panel (`tab` to it), `+` subscribes a connection to another topic filter and
`⏎` on a subscription edits its filter (emptied, the subscription is removed). A connected broker
subscribes and unsubscribes at once, and the connections file keeps the change.

Connections are kept in a small file you can edit:
`~/.config/fss-mqtt/connections.toml` (Linux, macOS; `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is honoured) or
`%APPDATA%\fss-mqtt\connections.toml` (Windows); `--config` picks another file.

```toml
[[connection]]
name         = "local"
url          = "mqtts://127.0.0.1:8883"
cafile       = "~/secrets/ca.pem"          # also: cert, key, insecure = true
username     = "backend"
password_env = "BROKER_PW"                 # read from this environment variable
client_id    = "fss-mqtt-ci"               # optional; random by default
qos          = 1                           # optional; 0 by default
topics       = ["devices/+/up/#", "$SYS/#"]
paused       = ["$SYS/#"]                  # listed, but not subscribed
capture      = ["devices/d1/#"]            # written to disk; see Capture to disk
autoconnect  = true                        # connect when started without -c or a broker

[[connection]]
name         = "plant"
url          = "wss://mqtt.example.com/mqtt"          # MQTT over WebSockets
headers      = ["CF-Access-Client-Id: 1a2b.access"]   # sent with the WebSocket handshake
headers_env  = ["CF-Access-Client-Secret: CF_SECRET"]  # its value from $CF_SECRET
proxy        = "http://alice@proxy.corp:8080"         # or "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
proxy_password_env = "PROXY_PW"                       # alice's password
```

- **Adding:** connect from the command line (the entry is added or updated, named `user@host:port`
  or `--name`; `--no-save` skips this), or add a block to the file. `--cafile`, `--cert` and
  `--key` are saved as absolute paths, so the entry works from any directory; in the file you can
  also write `~/…`.
- **Passwords are never written.** Set `password_env`, or fss-mqtt asks when it connects and keeps
  the password in memory only. `FSS_MQTT_PASSWORD` is saved as `password_env`; `-P` is not.
  The passphrase of an encrypted `--key` works the same way: `key_password_env` in the file
  (`FSS_MQTT_KEY_PASSWORD` is saved as that), or it's asked for, and asked again if it's wrong.
  Supported: PKCS#8 `ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY` with PBKDF2 and AES or 3DES (what `openssl genpkey
  -aes256` and `openssl pkcs8 -topk8` write) and the older OpenSSL `Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED`
  RSA/EC keys; not scrypt or PKCS#5 v1.5.
- **Headers** go with a WebSocket connection's opening request, for a broker behind a proxy or
  gateway that wants them (Cloudflare Access, an `Authorization: Bearer …` check, an API key).
  `headers` are sent as written; for a secret, `headers_env` names the environment variable that
  holds the value, so the secret stays out of the file. The handshake's own headers (`Host`,
  `Upgrade`, `Sec-WebSocket-…`) can't be set, though a `User-Agent` of your own replaces
  fss-mqtt's. A query in a `ws://`/`wss://` URL is sent too, and saved with the connection, but not
  shown in the panel; a signed URL that expires (AWS SigV4, say) stops working when it does.
- **Proxies:** `proxy` reaches the broker through an HTTP proxy (`http://host:port`, with CONNECT)
  or a SOCKS5 one (`socks5://host:port`, an `ssh -D` tunnel say), for any kind of broker URL: TLS,
  WebSockets and MQTT run over the tunnel as they would without it, and the broker's name is the
  proxy's to resolve (with `socks5://` too, which curl takes to resolve locally; `socks5h://` is
  accepted and means the same). A user in the proxy URL (percent-encoded, as in any URL) logs in
  with the password in `proxy_password_env` (Basic for HTTP proxies); a password in the URL isn't
  read, and `proxy_password_env` without a user is an error. Many proxies only let tunnels
  through to port 443, which a broker's `wss://…:443` is made for. Not supported: NTLM or Kerberos
  logins, TLS to the proxy itself, PAC files, and `HTTPS_PROXY`-style variables (`--proxy` and
  `FSS_MQTT_PROXY` are fss-mqtt's own).
- **Saving** rewrites only that connection's block, so your comments elsewhere in the file stay.
  Pausing or resuming a subscription in the panel is saved the same way.
- **Live:** edits to the file apply while fss-mqtt runs (it checks once a second). New connections
  appear (and connect if `autoconnect`), removed ones disconnect and leave the tree, changed
  subscriptions are (un)subscribed on the open connection, and any other change reconnects with
  the new settings. A file with an error is reported and not applied. The panel's bottom border
  shows the file's path.

The panel at the top lists each connection with its subscriptions, ten rows at most (five
connections with a subscription each); the rest scroll, and its bottom border says how many are out
of view. `tab` moves between the panel, the topic tree and the message list; in the panel, `space`
or `⏎` connects or disconnects a connection, or turns a subscription (subscribed and unsubscribed
live) or a capture rule on or off.

| Flag | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `-c, --connection` | | saved connection to connect (repeatable) |
| `--name` | `user@host:port` | name to save the broker under |
| `--no-save` | | don't add the broker to the connections file |
| `--config` | see above | connections file |
| `-t, --topic` | `#` | topic filter to subscribe to (repeatable) |
| `--history` | `10` | messages kept per topic |
| `--max-payload` | `4KiB` | payload bytes kept per message; the rest is discarded on arrival |
| `--inline` | `64` | payloads up to this size are shown inline in the tree; larger ones show only their size |
| `-q, --qos` | `0` | subscription QoS |
| `--cafile` | | PEM file of CA certificates to trust (implies TLS) |
| `--cert`, `--key` | | client certificate and key (PEM) for mutual TLS; the key may be encrypted |
| `--insecure` | | skip TLS certificate verification |
| `--proxy` | | proxy to reach the broker through: `http://[user@]host:port` or `socks5://[user@]host:port` (also `FSS_MQTT_PROXY`; the user's password from `FSS_MQTT_PROXY_PASSWORD`) |
| `--capture` | | topic filter to capture to disk (repeatable; see [Capture to disk](#capture-to-disk)) |
| `--capture-dir` | current directory | where capture files go (also `FSS_MQTT_CAPTURE_DIR`) |
| `--vim` | | vim keys for moving around (also `FSS_MQTT_KEYS=vim`; see [Vim keys](#vim-keys---vim)) |

## Filtering

Just type — the tree updates on every keystroke and the cursor jumps to the first match.

- **Pattern** (input contains `/`, `+` or `#`): MQTT-style. `v1/#`, `v1/+/temp`, `+/+/status`.
  The last level is a case-insensitive *prefix*, so `v1/pl` already shows `v1/plant`, and
  everything below a match is included.
- **Search** (anything else): case-insensitive substring over the full topic path; matches are
  underlined.
- **`!`** alone: the topics with an [anomaly](#anomalies) flagged.
- **`level=value`** (`site=oslo`): the topics whose [unified namespace](#unified-namespace) level of
  that name starts with the value.

`backspace` deletes a character, `ctrl+w` deletes back to the previous level, `esc`/`ctrl+u`
clears. Clearing keeps the tree open at the topic you were on.

## Keys

| Where | Key | |
|---|---|---|
| anywhere | `tab` / `shift+tab` | next / previous pane: connections, topics, messages, chart |
| connections | `↑ ↓ pgup pgdn home end` | move |
| connections | `space` | connect / disconnect, or subscription / capture rule on / off |
| connections | `⏎` | on a connection or capture rule as `space`; on a subscription, edit its topic filter (emptied, it's removed) |
| connections | `+` | subscribe the connection to another topic filter |
| tree | `↑ ↓ pgup pgdn home end` | move |
| tree | `→` | expand; on a topic with messages, enter its message list |
| tree | `←` | collapse, or jump to parent |
| tree | `⏎` | open the latest message full screen |
| messages | `↑ ↓` | pick one of the last 10 messages (properties and payload follow) |
| messages | `⏎` | open it full screen |
| messages | `← esc` | back to the tree |
| chart | `↑ ↓ home end pgup pgdn` | pick the column or field to chart (see [Charts](#charts)) |
| chart | `← →` (`shift`: a page) | scroll through the rows (or messages) when there are more than fit |
| chart | `⏎` | open the message full screen, as its chart |
| chart | `esc` | back to the tree |
| full screen | `↑ ↓ pgup pgdn` | scroll |
| full screen | `← →` | older / newer message |
| full screen | `shift ←→` `<` `>` | pan wide tables (CSV, Parquet) |
| full screen | `tab` | cycle formatted / chart (when it has numbers) / raw / hex |
| full screen | `esc q ⏎` | close |
| tree, messages | `ctrl+e` | publish: edit a copy of the selected message (or a new one on the topic) and send it |
| full screen | `e` | publish: edit a copy of this message and send it |
| tree, messages | `ctrl+t` / `ctrl+y` | copy the topic / the message (see [Clipboard](#clipboard)) |
| full screen | `t` / `y` | copy the topic / what the view shows |
| tree, messages | `ctrl+r` | capture this topic and everything below it to disk; again to stop |
| anywhere | `ctrl+x` | export the selected branch (on a connection's row, all of it) as JSON and CSV (see [Exporting](#exporting-a-namespace)) |
| anywhere | `ctrl+n` | with a newer release out: install it (see [Updating](#updating)); when a newer fss-mqtt was installed meanwhile: restart into it, continuing the session |
| anywhere | `ctrl+c` | quit (saving the session for `--resume`) |

A green `•`/`▸` means the topic (or something under it) received a message in the last 1.5 s.

Colours follow `$COLORFGBG` for light terminals (e.g. `export COLORFGBG='0;15'`) and default to dark.
Terminals without 24-bit colour (Apple Terminal, for one) get the nearest colours from the
256-colour palette instead; 24-bit colour is used when `COLORTERM=truecolor` is set, in iTerm2,
WezTerm, VS Code, Ghostty and on Windows. `FSS_MQTT_COLOR=truecolor` or `=256` overrides the guess.

### Clipboard

`ctrl+t` copies the selected topic's path (without the connection name). `ctrl+y` copies the
message: a text payload as it is, a binary one as its formatted view (or a hex dump). Full screen,
`y` copies what the view shows: formatted, raw or hex, with tables as whole rows. A payload cut on
arrival (`--max-payload`) copies what was kept, and the status line says so.

The copy goes to the system clipboard with `pbcopy` (macOS), the Windows clipboard, or `wl-copy`,
`xclip` or `xsel` (Linux and BSD with a display). Over SSH, or with none of those, it goes through
the terminal instead (an OSC 52 escape sequence, up to 768 KB of text), which lands on the
clipboard of the machine you're sitting at. Most terminals support it (iTerm2, kitty, WezTerm,
Alacritty, Windows Terminal, foot; Apple Terminal doesn't). In tmux, enable it with
`set -g set-clipboard on`. `FSS_MQTT_CLIPBOARD=osc52`, `=native` or `=off` overrides the choice.

## Vim keys (`--vim`)

With `--vim` (or `FSS_MQTT_KEYS=vim`), letters move around instead of filtering, as in Ranger;
`/` starts the filter. The other [keys](#keys) keep working, apart from `ctrl+u`, which pages up
(in messages, to the first one).

![fss-mqtt --vim: j and l through the tree, / to filter, j and k to pick a message, h and l to older and newer ones full screen, y to copy, e to publish a copy, ctrl+d, ctrl+u, G and g through a Parquet table, q to quit; the keys pressed show below](docs/vim.gif)

| Where | Key | |
|---|---|---|
| connections, tree, messages, chart | `j k` | down / up (like `↓ ↑`) |
| tree | `h l` | collapse / expand (like `← →`) |
| messages | `h` | back to the tree |
| chart | `h l` | scroll (like `← →`) |
| connections, tree, messages, chart | `g` / `G` | first / last (like `home` / `end`) |
| connections, tree, full screen | `ctrl+d` / `ctrl+u` | page down / up |
| messages, chart | `ctrl+d` / `ctrl+u` | last / first (like `pgdn` / `pgup`) |
| connections, tree, messages | `/` | filter: type it, then `⏎` keeps it and goes back to moving, `esc` clears it |
| anywhere | `e` | publish (like `ctrl+e`) |
| tree, messages | `t` / `y` | copy the topic / the message (like `ctrl+t` / `ctrl+y`) |
| connections, tree, messages | `q` | quit (like `ctrl+c`) |

Full screen, `j k` scroll, `g G` go to the top and the end, `h l` step to older and newer messages
and `q` closes the view, with or without `--vim`.

While filtering, letters go to the filter, and `backspace`, `ctrl+w` and `ctrl+u` edit it as in
[Filtering](#filtering); while moving they leave it alone. `tab` keeps the filter and goes back to
moving.

## Publishing

`ctrl+e` (`e` full screen) opens the message in focus as a document you can edit and send:
the topic in the tree, the one picked in the message list, or the one on screen. On a topic
without messages it starts an empty one for that topic.

```
topic: site/oslo/turbine/T01/telemetry
connection: oslo
qos: 1
retain: no
content-type: application/json
user: TurbineId = T01

{"ts":"2026-10-15T10:20:30Z","power_kw":2265.8}
```

- Headers come first, one `key: value` per line; the first blank line starts the payload, which
  is sent exactly as written. Headers: `topic`, `connection` (any connected one, so you can
  replay a message into another broker), `qos`, `retain` (`yes`/`no`), `content-type`,
  `response-topic`, `correlation-data`, `message-expiry` (seconds), `payload-format`
  (`utf8`/`bytes`), `user: key = value` (repeatable) and `encoding`.
- Payloads that aren't plain text (binary, or text with control characters such as CR LF) open
  as base64 with `encoding: base64`; `encoding: hex` reads hex digits instead. Correlation data
  that isn't text is written `base64:…`.
- The message expiry isn't copied: brokers forward the time a message has left, not the expiry
  it was published with, so the copy would expire early. Add `message-expiry:` to give it one.
- A payload cut off on arrival (larger than `--max-payload`) can't be sent unchanged: edit it,
  or restart with a larger `--max-payload` to republish it whole.
- An empty payload with `retain: yes` clears the retained message on that topic.
- `ctrl+s` sends, `esc` cancels (twice if you've edited), `ctrl+f` switches a JSON payload
  between indented and compact. Mistakes are shown with their line, and the message isn't sent.
- The result appears on the status line: written (QoS 0), acknowledged (QoS 1) or completed
  (QoS 2), or the broker's reason for refusing it. Limits the broker announces (largest packet,
  highest QoS, retained messages, how many unacknowledged messages it takes) are checked before
  sending.

## Payload formats

The payload is shown formatted, in the details pane (as much as fits) and full screen (`⏎`). The
format comes from the `content-type` property when there is one, otherwise from the payload itself:

| Format | Shown as |
|---|---|
| JSON, JSON lines | indented and coloured; a cut-off document is formatted as far as it goes |
| XML | indented, short elements on one line, tags/attributes/values coloured |
| CSV, TSV (`,` `;` tab `|`) | an aligned table, numbers right-aligned |
| Parquet | row count, row groups, writer and file metadata; the schema with types, null counts and min/max; the first rows as a table |
| Avro container files | schema, record count and codec, the first records as a table; schema-registry framing is recognised and explained |
| Arrow IPC (file and stream) | schema, record batches and row count, the first rows as a table |
| SQLite database | file header, tables with columns and row counts, indexes/views/triggers, the first rows of each table |
| MessagePack, CBOR (by `content-type`) | decoded and shown as JSON |
| gzip, zstd | unpacked on arrival; what's inside is detected and formatted like any other payload |
| Protobuf (by content-type) | raw field numbers and values, nested messages indented; no schema needed |
| Sparkplug B (on `spBv1.0/…` topics) | message type, seq and timestamp; the metrics as a table with names, types and values; data sets and templates as tables |
| SQLite changeset / patchset | per table, the inserts, updates (old → new) and deletes |
| Elspec PQZip | the recording's start and end, the analyser (names, model, firmware, MAC) and its channels' nominal values |
| other text / binary | text / hex dump |

Binary formats are decoded when the message arrives, while the whole payload is still there; what's
kept is the decoded result (about 4 KiB) next to the first `--max-payload` bytes. If a payload looks
like one of these formats but can't be read, the reason is shown above a hex dump of its first bytes.

- **Parquet:** flat columns with PLAIN and dictionary encodings, Snappy, Gzip, Zstd and LZ4
  compression; nested columns and rarer encodings show the schema with a note.
- **gzip, zstd:** at most 64 MiB is unpacked; the first 4 KiB of what's inside is kept, or the decoded
  view if it's another binary format (e.g. a zstd-compressed Parquet file).
- **Protobuf:** shown without a schema, like `protoc --decode_raw` (a gRPC message frame is stripped
  first): each length-delimited field is shown as text, a nested message, a packed list of small
  numbers or bytes, whichever it most likely is.
- **Sparkplug B:** recognised by its topic, `spBv1.0/{group}/{type}/{edge node}[/{device}]` with
  type `NBIRTH`, `NDATA`, `NCMD`, `NDEATH` or their `D…` device versions (`STATE` messages are
  JSON). Data and command messages usually name their metrics by alias only; the names and types
  come from the edge node's `NBIRTH` or the device's `DBIRTH`, which each connection remembers. A
  birth sent before fss-mqtt connected can't be seen, so its metrics show as `alias 7` until the
  next one (edge nodes send one when a host application asks for a rebirth). All Sparkplug 3.0 types
  are shown, arrays, data sets and templates included; payloads compressed the way Eclipse Tahu does
  are unpacked first.

  The metrics are also laid out as the namespace Sparkplug means, under `@sparkplug` in the
  connection's tree: `@sparkplug/{group}/{edge node}/{device}/{metric}` (a metric's `/` makes levels
  too), each with its latest value, and `@state` online or offline from births and deaths. They're
  topics like any: in the values table, charted, watched for anomalies and exported.
- **Avro:** container files are read with the schema in their header (uncompressed, Deflate, Snappy
  or Zstandard), nested values shown as compact JSON; Avro without its schema (Confluent
  schema-registry framing, single-object encoding) can't be decoded and says so.
- **Arrow IPC:** file and stream formats, LZ4 or Zstd compressed buffers, dictionary-encoded
  columns; nested values are shown inline (`[a, b]`, `{x: 1}`). Every column type is decoded,
  including the string and binary views recent Polars and DataFusion write by default (Utf8View,
  BinaryView), list views, run-end encoded columns and sparse or dense unions.
- **SQLite:** read directly from the file format: tables with columns and row counts, indexes,
  views and triggers, and the first rows of each table; WITHOUT ROWID tables, overflow pages and
  UTF-16 databases are read; in WAL mode, changes still in the `-wal` file aren't part of the payload.
- **SQLite changesets / patchsets** (from the session extension): recognised by a `content-type`
  containing `changeset` or `patchset`, or without one when the whole payload reads as one; the
  format doesn't carry column names, so columns are numbered (`pk c0`, `c1`, …).
- **Elspec PQZip** (the files Elspec's BLACKBOX power quality analysers record): recognised by its
  header. The measurements after the header, the per-cycle voltages, currents and harmonics, are
  in a layout not worked out yet; their size is shown. Times are the analyser's clock.

## Charts

A topic with numbers gets a chart in the lower half of its details, when the window has room for
both. On a narrow screen the panes stack: the connections panel stays short, and a topic with a
chart is given the rows for a shorter one, so it still shows on a phone-sized window. `tab` goes
to the chart from the message list, and `↑ ↓` pick what it shows. Full screen, `tab` shows a
message's chart over the whole screen, after its formatted view, and `⏎` on the chart opens it
there; `shift ←→` pans it:

![fss-mqtt charts: a turbine's telemetry fields over the messages kept, live, and on the next turbine the same field; the columns of a Parquet fast log and of a CSV report; the keys pressed show below](docs/chart.gif)

- **The columns of a table in the message** (Parquet, Arrow, Avro, SQLite, CSV, Sparkplug
  DataSets), row by row. The x axis goes by the first column when that's text (a time, a name),
  otherwise by row number. On arrival, a decoded table keeps its first rows (up to 200, about 4 KB
  of text). The newest message of a topic whose payload is a Parquet, Arrow or Avro table, or CSV,
  is kept whole as well (see [Performance notes](#performance-notes)), so its chart reads the
  table again, all of it (up to 100,000 rows), in the background. For an older message, or one
  past that budget, the chart has the first rows (`first 52 of 500 rows`), and its bottom border
  says which `--max-payload` would keep every message whole (`--max-payload 1MiB keeps all`).
- **JSON arrays** of numbers, or of records (`[{"ts": "…", "kw": 1.5}, …]`): each array, or each
  number field of the records, item by item. MessagePack and CBOR count as JSON.
- **The numbers each message carries:** a payload that's a number, a JSON document's number fields
  (`power_kw`, `pos.x`), Sparkplug metrics. Each one over the messages kept (`--history`, 10 by
  default), by arrival time. Raise `--history` for a longer chart; `fss-mqtt --open capture.jsonl
  --history 100000` charts a whole capture.

The chart is of the message picked in the message list (the latest one otherwise). Its heading
says where the numbers come from and their range, and a column or field you pick stays picked on
other topics that have one by that name. With more rows (or messages) than fit, it shows a stretch
of them, one to a dot, and `← →` scroll through (a quarter of the view at a time, `shift` a whole
view); the bottom border says which are in view (`rows 1,201–1,400`). A message's rows start at
the first; the numbers each message carries start at the newest, and keep following them until
you scroll back. With all of it in view, `← →` say so, and what would keep more.

## Anomalies

fss-mqtt watches every topic as its messages arrive and flags what doesn't look usual:

- **spike**: a number far outside its usual range (6 standard deviations), e.g.
  `power_kw 9800 (usual 900–3600)`. Flagged for 5 minutes.
- **stuck**: a number that usually changes has repeated one value 20 times (a frozen sensor).
- **silent**: a topic that publishes regularly has said nothing for 4 of its usual intervals (and
  at least 5 seconds) while its connection is up.
- **drift**: a JSON payload's shape changed: a field's type (`value: number → string`), a field that
  was always there is gone, or a new one appeared. Flagged for 5 minutes; the new shape is then the
  usual one.
- **uns**: the topic doesn't fit its connection's [unified namespace](#unified-namespace).

The numbers are those a chart would show: JSON fields, a number payload, Sparkplug metrics. Each
check waits for 20 messages to learn what's usual first, and keeps a running mean and spread
weighted to about the last 30, so it costs a few numbers per field and nothing per message worth
noticing. A flagged topic says why in red in the tree (`! spike`), a collapsed branch how many it
hides (`!2`), the header the total (`! 2 anomalies`), and its details the reason and since when.
Type `!` to see only the flagged topics.

## Unified namespace

A connection can declare the levels of its unified namespace (UNS), topmost first:

```toml
[[connection]]
name   = "factory"
url    = "mqtt://uns.example.com"
topics = ["acme/#"]
uns    = ["enterprise", "site", "area", "line", "cell"]
```

Then:

- **Each topic is checked** against it: it must have every level, and each level is lower case
  letters, digits, `-` and `_`. One that doesn't is flagged `! uns` with the reason (`missing the
  line and cell levels`, `area "Packaging Hall": lower case letters, digits, - and _ only`).
- **Its details name the levels**: `enterprise acme · site oslo · area packaging · line line1`.
- **`level=value` filters by a level**: `site=oslo`, `area=pack`, `line=` (any line). The value is a
  prefix, as in patterns.

On any connection, a branch's details list the **values** of every topic below it: a line, a cell
or an asset as one table. A `{"value": …, "unit": …, "quality": …}` payload, as UNS tags often
are, shows its value, unit and a quality other than good; any other shows a short text or number,
its first numbers, or what it is. Flags show there too.

The web version's `acme` connection is such a namespace, with a few topics that break it and two
that drift now and then.

## Exporting a namespace

`ctrl+x` writes the topics at and below the selected node (a branch, an asset, or on a
connection's row in the panel, the whole connection) to two files in the capture directory
(`--capture-dir`, the current directory by default), `fss-mqtt-{connection}-{path}-{time}.json` and
`.csv`; the web version downloads them. For each topic:

| field | |
|---|---|
| `topic`, `levels` | its path, and its [unified namespace](#unified-namespace) levels |
| `format`, `content_type` | what the payload is, and its content type |
| `messages`, `retained`, `last`, `every_s` | how many arrived, whether retained, when the last did, the usual interval |
| `value`, `unit`, `quality` | its latest value (see the values table) |
| `fields` | its JSON payload's fields and their types, as learnt |
| `flag` | what's flagged, if anything |
| `example` | the latest payload, when it's text |

The JSON also names the connection, its URL and levels, and when it was exported: a model of the
namespace to document, review or compare.

## Capture to disk

Messages are captured only when you ask for it, per topic (apart from the session saved when you
quit, see [Sessions](#sessions)). `ctrl+r` on a topic in the tree or the
message list captures that topic and everything below it (`topic/#`; on a connection's row, all of
it), and `ctrl+r` again stops. A topic inside a subtree that's already captured says so rather than
getting a rule of its own. The rules are listed in the connections panel, where `space` turns one off
and on; captured topics get a red `●` in the tree, and the header shows `● capturing` while anything
is.

Rules are saved with the connection (`capture = ["site/oslo/#"]`, and `capture_paused` for those
turned off), so they apply again next time; `--capture FILTER` (repeatable) sets them for the broker
on the command line. Editing them in the connections file applies live, without reconnecting.

Each connection writes one file per run, created when the first matching message arrives:
`fss-mqtt-<connection>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.jsonl` in the current directory, or in `--capture-dir`
(`FSS_MQTT_CAPTURE_DIR`). Its full path is shown when it's created and in the connection's details;
on Unix it's readable by you only. Payloads are written whole, however large: `--max-payload` only
limits what's kept in memory. A thread of its own writes each file, so a slow disk never holds up
the connection: lines reach the file at least once a second, and quitting waits up to 5 s for what's
still queued. If writing fails (a full disk, no permission), or more than 64 MB is waiting because
the disk can't keep up, capture stops for that connection and says why; turning a rule off and on
again resumes it (in a new file after a failed write).

One message per line ([JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org)):

```json
{"time":"2026-10-15T08:20:30.123Z","topic":"site/oslo/turbine/T01/telemetry","qos":1,"retain":false,"content_type":"application/json","user":[["TurbineId","T01"]],"size":34,"payload":"{\"power_kw\":2265.8,\"wind_ms\":11.5}"}
```

`time` is when it arrived (UTC). `content_type`, `response_topic`, `correlation_data` (base64),
`message_expiry`, `payload_format` and `user` appear when the message has them. The payload is
`payload` when it's UTF-8 text and `payload_base64` otherwise; `size` is its length in bytes.

```sh
# T01's power readings, one number per line
jq -r 'select(.topic | endswith("T01/telemetry")) | .payload | fromjson | .power_kw' fss-mqtt-oslo-*.jsonl
```

### Opening a capture

```sh
fss-mqtt --open fss-mqtt-oslo-20261015-102030.jsonl            # browse it offline
fss-mqtt --open fss-mqtt-oslo-20261015-102030.jsonl -c staging # …and send messages on to staging
```

`--open` (repeatable) reads a capture file, plain or gzip-compressed (`.jsonl.gz`), into the tree
under a connection named after the file (`≡` in the panel), as if its messages were arriving: the
last 10 per topic are kept, binary formats are decoded, Sparkplug B names come from its births, and
each message keeps the time it arrived. Large files load in the background, with the progress in
the panel; lines that can't be read are skipped and counted. A file never connects: saved
connections stay disconnected unless you name them (`-c`) or give a broker, and `ctrl+e` on a
message from the file opens it to send to one of those (a connected one is filled in).

## Sessions

When you quit, fss-mqtt saves the session and tells you how to continue it:

```
$ fss-mqtt
…
Continue session: fss-mqtt --resume
```

`fss-mqtt --resume` brings back the messages it held (the last 10 per topic, as kept), the
connections that were open (a `--no-save` broker included, never its password) and where you were:
the filter, the expanded topics, the selected one, the pane, and an unsent publish draft.
Connections that were connected connect again, asking for passwords as usual, and new messages
arrive on top. Without `--resume` it starts fresh, as always; the session stays until the next quit
that received something from a broker (only browsing files with `--open` leaves it as it was).

Restored messages come back through the same decoders as arriving ones, so a format a newer version
added shows on messages saved before it; views decoded from payloads that were cut on arrival
(`--max-payload`) and Sparkplug B views are kept as they were, as are the names Sparkplug births
gave to aliases, so data arriving after `--resume` is still named. Each message keeps the time it
arrived (to the millisecond). Typical use, across an upgrade:

```sh
fss-mqtt                 # … quit: "Continue session: fss-mqtt --resume"
brew upgrade fss-mqtt
fss-mqtt --resume
```

You don't even have to quit to upgrade: fss-mqtt notices when the fss-mqtt it was started as is
replaced on disk (`brew upgrade`, `scoop update`, a new build) and says so in the header
(`↑ 0.7.0 · ^n restart`). `ctrl+n` then saves the session and restarts into the new version with
`--resume`, with the same command-line arguments. On Windows, where a program can't replace itself
in place, it saves the session, quits and prints the command to continue.

The session is one gzip-compressed [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org) file, readable by you only:
`~/Library/Application Support/fss-mqtt/session.jsonl.gz` on macOS, `$XDG_STATE_HOME/fss-mqtt/`
(`~/.local/state/fss-mqtt/`) on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\fss-mqtt\` on Windows. Its lines are capture
lines with the connection added, under one header line; `--open` reads it too. A session saved by a
newer fss-mqtt, in a newer format, is refused with a message rather than misread; a damaged one is
continued as far as it can be read, and the status line says so. `--no-session`
(or `FSS_MQTT_SESSION=off`) never writes one, for machines where payloads must not touch the disk.

`FSS_MQTT_KEYS=vim` turns on vim keys like `--vim`, the way `FSS_MQTT_SESSION=off` stands in for
`--no-session`.

## Updating

fss-mqtt looks for a newer release when it starts, at most once a day, and daily while it runs: it
asks where `github.com/mbilling/fss-mqtt/releases/latest` leads, and sends nothing else. When there's
one, the header says so (`↑ 0.9.0 available · ^n update`), and `ctrl+n` installs it the way this
fss-mqtt was installed, then restarts into it, continuing the session:

- **Homebrew:** `brew update`, then `brew upgrade mbilling/tap/fss-mqtt`, in the background.
- **A release archive or `cargo install`:** the release's archive for this platform is downloaded,
  checked against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, run once (`--version`) to be sure it works here, and
  put in place of the running program. On Windows the running one is moved aside, and removed the
  next time fss-mqtt starts.
- **Scoop** doesn't update a program while it runs: quit, `scoop update fss-mqtt`, then
  `fss-mqtt --resume`.
- **A `.deb` or `.rpm`** needs your package manager and sudo: install the new package from the
  release page.

On Windows the restart is yours to do: fss-mqtt quits and prints the command to continue. Downloads
go straight to GitHub over HTTPS, not through a proxy. The `SHA256SUMS` check catches a broken
download, not a tampered release: it comes from the same release, so trusting it means trusting
GitHub and the TLS to it, as when you download a release by hand. `FSS_MQTT_UPDATE=off` turns looking for
releases off, and then no request is made.

## Performance notes

Messages are written straight into an in-memory tree; the UI redraws at ~15 fps rather than per
message, and only the visible rows are rendered. Large payloads are never rendered in the tree. Each
topic keeps its last `--history` messages (10), and each message keeps only the first `--max-payload`
bytes (4 KiB); the rest is discarded as it arrives, so a topic costs at most about 40 KiB of payload
however large or frequent its messages are (captured topics are written to disk whole, as they
arrive). The one exception is for [charts](#charts): the newest message of a topic whose payload is
a table (Parquet, Arrow, Avro, CSV) is kept whole too, up to 64 MB for all topics together, the
ones kept longest making room. Filtering 100k topics takes a few milliseconds.

The MQTT client (`src/mqtt.rs`) is a small MQTT v5 client on blocking I/O with one thread per
connection and no async runtime, which keeps the binary around 1 MB. TLS uses rustls.

## Web version

The web version at <https://mbilling.github.io/fss-mqtt/> is the same app built for the browser
(WebAssembly), with the same keys, panes, viewer and charts. It starts with four demo connections
whose data is made in the page (two wind-farm sites; `acme`, a factory's
[unified namespace](#unified-namespace); and `plant`, Sparkplug B from an edge node with a press and
an oven), and a live one to the public test broker
`wss://test.mosquitto.org:8081/mqtt`, subscribed to its `$SYS/#` statistics. That broker comes
and goes: when it hasn't answered in 10 seconds, the page connects to EMQX's public broker
(`wss://broker.emqx.io:8084/mqtt`) instead, subscribed to `fss-mqtt/#`, where what you publish
comes back.

Point it at your own broker with the page's address:

```
https://mbilling.github.io/fss-mqtt/?broker=wss://broker.example.com:8884/mqtt&topic=v1/%23&topic=alerts
```

`topic` can be repeated (`#` is `%23` in an address) and defaults to `#`. A page can only reach
brokers over WebSockets, and from an https page only `wss://` ones; it can't send headers, use a
proxy or certificate files of its own, or write to disk (capture, sessions). Nothing is saved.
On a phone or tablet, tap a row to select it and again to open it, swipe to move, and use the
key bar for the keys a phone has none of; tap the filter line (or abc) for the keyboard.
For a chart full screen, open the message (tap it twice) and tab to its chart, or tab to the chart
pane and press enter; esc goes back. The key bar's esc, enter and tab are those keys.
Copies go to the browser's clipboard. Chrome on Windows and Linux keeps Ctrl+T and Ctrl+W for its
tabs, so the page also takes Alt+T (copy the topic) and Alt+W (filter: back a level).

## Development

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs fmt, clippy and tests on Linux, macOS and Windows, checks the
minimum Rust version, runs the end-to-end test against mosquitto (plain, TLS and mutual TLS, and capture to disk), and guards the
release binary size. `.github/workflows/web.yml` builds the web version with
[trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) and publishes it to GitHub Pages with each release; locally,
`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`, then `trunk serve web/index.html`.

```sh
cargo test
# end-to-end: starts mosquitto on 127.0.0.1:18830 (plain), localhost:18883 (TLS) and
# localhost:18884 (mutual TLS, with an encrypted client key)
scripts/e2e-brokers.sh /tmp/fss-brokers
FSS_TEST_CA=/tmp/fss-brokers/ca.pem cargo test --release e2e -- --ignored --nocapture
# filter benchmark over 100k topics:
cargo test --release bench_filter -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The demo GIF is recorded with [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) against two throwaway
brokers fed with simulated wind-farm data, all in Docker: build a static Linux binary for your
Docker architecture (e.g. `cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`), then run
`docs/demo/record.sh <that binary>`. The script is `docs/demo/demo.tape`; the sample payloads it
opens, one per format, are generated by `docs/demo/samples/make_samples.py`.
